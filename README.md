# Intro to Self Driving Cars Nanodegree Program
In this repository you can find my own solutions to the Flying Car Nanodegree Program projects.

* **Link**: [Intro to Self Driving Cars Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-self-driving-cars--nd113)
* **Description**: Work on self-driving car problems using Python, C++, matrices and calculus in code, and computer vision/machine learning.


## Core Curriculum
This section enumerates the courses taken in this nanodegree and the projects completed

### Bayesian Thinking
Bayesian thinking involves the mathematical framework that underlies a self-driving car's understanding of itself and the world around it. This course presents the localization methodology used by the self-driving car to accurately estimate of its location in the world.

* **Project**: 2D Histogram Filtering

### C++ Basics
This course introduces the usage of C++ in self-driving cars. The project involves the translation of a given program written in Python into C++

* **Project**: Implement a matrix class
 
### Performance Programming in C++
This course focuses on how to write good code that runs correctly. Primary focus is made on the low level language features of C++ which can make C++ fast.

* **Project**: Translate Python to C++

### Navigating Complex Data Structures
Navigating Complex Data Structures involves the algorithm implementation based on Algorithmic thinking that show up most frequently in self-driving cars.

* **Project**: Planning and Optimal Path

### Visualizing Calculus and ntrols 
You will learn the basics of calculus, the mathematics of continuity. Also, you will learn to use some of Python's most popular visualization libraries.

* **Project**: Reconstructing Trajectories
